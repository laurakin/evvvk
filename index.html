  <p>Innovation has nothing to do with how many R&D dollars you have. When
Apple came up with the Mac, IBM was spending at least 100 times more on R&D.
It's not about money. It's about the people you have, how youâ€™re led, and how
much you get it. Steve Jobs</p>
<p>He that is of the opinion money will do everything may well be suspected of
doing everything for money. Benjamin Franklin</p>
